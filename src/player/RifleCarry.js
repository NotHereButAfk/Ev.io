//           What a bot/player snaps to the instant it engages.
//
// Both were solved with 2-bone IK against the low-poly rig (shoulder pivots at
// y=1.76 ±0.27, elbows at y=1.28, hands at y=0.895) so the right hand lands

// muzzle is its own local −Z.

 * Place the rifle, then solve both arms onto it.

 * handguard every frame. That means the hands are exactly on the gun at any
 * blend value, any stride phase, any recoil state — there is no pose pair to
 * drift apart, which is what happens if you interpolate arms and weapon
 * separately along their own paths.
 *
 * `swing` is the life in the pose — breathing at rest, the rifle riding the
 * stride while moving. It rotates the rifle about the shoulder line, and the
 * arms simply follow it.
 *
 * @param {object} rig     { armL, armR, elbowL, elbowR } limb pivots
 * @param {THREE.Object3D} weapon  the weapon model parented to the body (or null)
 * @param {number} aim     0 = patrol carry, 1 = shouldered and aiming
 * @param {number} dt      frame delta (seconds) — unused, kept for callers
 * @param {object} [o]     { aimPitch, swing, kick, reload, swap, flinch, throwP, smooth }
 *   `aimPitch` is where this body is SHOOTING, in radians against the horizon
 *   (positive up) — pass the look pitch, or for a bot the elevation of the ray
 *   it actually fires. Shouldered, the muzzle comes out on exactly that angle.
 *   Do not pre-scale it; the shoulder blend, the body's own lean (`bodyPitch`,
 *   pass whatever you set on the body's rotation.x) and the pose's droop are
 *   all handled here.
 *   reload/swap/flinch/throwP are 0→1 action progresses. They move the WEAPON
 *   (and, for a reload, the support hand's target on it) — never the arms
 *   directly, because the arms are IK'd onto wherever the weapon ends up and
