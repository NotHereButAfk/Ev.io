// Skinned-surface construction for the player body.
//
// The body used to be a parts bin bolted onto pivot groups: a thigh tube, a
// knee ball, a calf tube, each rigid, each rotating about its own joint. Bend a
// knee past about 60° and it reads as exactly that — two pipes sliding past one
// another with a ball wedged in the gap. No amount of extra geometry fixes it,
// because the problem is that the surface is DISCONTINUOUS across the joint.
//
// So a limb is now ONE surface running from hip to ankle, and it bends because
// its vertices are weighted between bones. That is what a character model is.
//
// Two things here are deliberately not the usual approach:
//
//   1. Weights are DERIVED, not painted and not guessed from bone proximity.
//      Generic auto-skinning weights a vertex by its distance to nearby bone
//      segments, which on a humanoid bleeds across the gap between the thighs
//      (0.22 apart, limbs 0.1 thick — the inner thigh is nearly as close to the
//      far bone as its own). Here the surfaces are generated, so every vertex
//      already knows which limb it belongs to and how far along it sits. The
//      blend comes straight out of that: exact, symmetric, and with no chance
//      of a left-leg vertex picking up the right femur.
//
//   2. The blend is a smoothstep over a band around each joint, sized to the
//      flesh that actually creases there — wider at the knee than the wrist.
//      Linear blend skinning pinches at a bend, so joint bands also carry extra
//      cross-sections and a slight radius gain, which is the cheap standard
//      answer to the "candy wrapper" collapse.
