// Body proportions — one source of truth for the figure everything is built on.
//
// These numbers used to be copied into three files: the skeleton in
// HeroBody.js, the ground solve in Locomotion.js, and the arm IK in
// RifleCarry.js. Nothing derived them from anything, so the only thing keeping
// them equal was that nobody had touched them. That is the same shape of bug
// that had the gun aiming 24° off the shot (three call sites, three opinions),
// so the figure lives here now and the other three import it.
//
// ─── WHY THESE NUMBERS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The body was a 2.21m figure — 7'3" — while Player.js puts your eyes at 1.70m.
// The character you saw was not the character you were: a third-person body
// whose eyes sat 28cm above your own, on stilt ankles 12.2% of its height off
// the floor where a human ankle is 3.9%, with arms 17% longer than human and a
// head big enough to make it six heads tall instead of seven and a half.
//
// So the figure is now built from standard adult anthropometry, expressed as
// fractions of stature, at the ONE stature that agrees with the game: eye
// height 1.70m is 0.936 of stature, so stature is 1.816m. A real height for a
// tall adult, and the eyes land exactly where the camera already was.
//
// Landmark fractions are the conventional ones (eye 0.936, shoulder 0.820,
// elbow 0.630, wrist 0.485, hip joint 0.530, knee 0.285, ankle 0.039). Widths
// are joint spacings, NOT body breadths — the femoral heads sit ~0.045H off the
// midline even though the hips measure twice that across the outside, and
// confusing the two is how you end up "fixing" a hip that was already right.
